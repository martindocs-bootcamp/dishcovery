## Description

The DishCovery Project is a fun food web application designed to help users explore new recipes and cooking ideas, find complimentary drinks for their meal, obtain nutritional information and save their favourite searches.

The main motivation behind DishCovery is to push the initial concept (Dish Discovery) to the next level whilst inspiring culinary creativity that makes the process of finding new and exciting recipes more accessible.

The project was built to address the common challenge of deciding what to cook by providing a user-friendly interface for discovering, exploring, and saving recipes. It then helps in providing the user with drink choices as well as nutritional information based on their search.

It aims to solve the problem of monotony in cooking and meal planning by offering a diverse range of recipes and drinks for users to try.

During the development of this project, valuable insights into web development using libraries such as React, API integration via React components, and user experience/ user interface design were gained. Additionally, skills in handling data manipulation, project planning and collaborative work were honed.
